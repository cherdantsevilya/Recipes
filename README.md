## ðŸš€ **Description**

Sometimes it is very difficult to resist the desire to cook something special. But what if you lost the recipe? Or is your beloved grandmother too busy to answer the phone and remind you of the recipe for your favorite cake?

Let's solve this problem with `Recipes` - a program that can store all recipes in one place. The program is a multi-user web service based on Spring Boot, which allows you to store, extract, update and delete recipes. In fact, this is a REST API application that uses a lightweight H2 database as a recipe repository.
