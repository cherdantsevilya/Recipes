## ðŸš€ **Description**

Sometimes, it's useful to have a tool that can help you share a piece of code with other programmers. Actually, there is a website called Pastebin that does exactly that. A huge downside of Pastebin is that every piece of code you share automatically becomes available for the public. This could present a problem since many programmers work under the NDA (Non-disclosure agreement) which prohibits the use of such services to prevent the source code from leaking.

If there is a team of programmers who work in the same company and want to exchange pieces of code, they can solve this problem by using their own implementation of Pastebin. Such a web service is supposed to be accessible only locally, not via the Internet.
